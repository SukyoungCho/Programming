We'll grade your homework by

* opening your "hw3.Rmd" file in RStudio
* clicking "Knit HTML"
* reading the HTML output
* reading your "hw3.Rmd"

You should write R code anywhere you see an empty R code chunk. You
should write English text anywhere you see "..."; please surround it
with doubled asterisks (`**...**`) so that it will show up as boldface
and be easy for us to find.

Include reasonable labels (titles, axis labels, legends, etc.) with
each of your graphs.

We'll use data on housing values in suburbs of Boston. They are in an
R package called "MASS." (An R package is a collection of code,
data, and documentation. "MASS" refers to the book "Modern Applied
Statistics with S." R developed from the earlier language, S.) The
MASS package comes with the default R installation, so it's already on
your computer.  However, it's not loaded into your R session by
default. So we'll load it via the `require()` command (there's nothing
for you to do here):

```{r}
require("MASS")
```

Run `?Boston` (outside this R Markdown document) to read the help page for the `Boston` data frame.

Convert the `chas` variable to a factor with labels "off" and "on" (referring to the Charles river).

```{r}

**Boston$chas<-factor(Boston$chas, labels=c("Off", "On"))**

```

How many rows are in the Boston data frame? How many columns?

**
rows=dim(Boston)[1];rows
cols=dim(Boston)[2];cols
506 rows and 14 columns**


What does a row represent?

**row shows the set of values for each column**

What does a column represent?

**categories for what data mean. for example, per capita crime rate, nitrogen-oxide concentration and other variables.**

Make a density plot (with rug) of tax rates.

```{r}

**plot(density(Boston$tax))
rug(Boston$tax, col=2, lwd=5)**

```

Describe the shape of the distribution of tax rates.
...**it is a bimodal distribution with 2 peaks - one near 300 and the otehr near 660**

Note that the distribution shape doesn't make sense in light of the rug representation of the data. Make a histogram of the tax rates.

```{r}

**hist(Boston$tax)**

```

Why is the second peak of the density plot so large? In what way is the rug representation of the data inadequate? Write a line or two of code to figure it out, and then explain it.

```{r}

**plot(density(Boston$tax, bw=10))**
Too large bandwidth, which was 43.66, made a confusion. By narrowing the bandwidth, the graph shows more accurate shape that the right part of the graph has more data (666 is the most common).

```
...

Make a barplot of "chas".

```{r}
** 
table(Boston$chas)
barplot(table(Boston$chas)) **
```

How many neighborhoods are on the Charles river?

```{r}

** 
length(Boston$chas[Boston$chas == 1])
35 **

```


Make a single graph consisting of three plots: 

* a scatterplot of "nox" on the y-axis vs. "dis" on the x-axis 
* a (vertical) boxplot of "nox" left of the scatterplot's y-axis
* a (horizontal) boxplot of "dis" below the scatterplot's x-axis

Hint: use `layout()` with a 4x4 matrix, using the top-right 3x3 corner
for the scatterplot, leaving the bottom-left 1x1 corner blank, and
using the other parts for the boxplots.

(An optional challenge, worth 0 extra credit points: remove the axis
and plot border from each boxplot.)

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
***
draw = matrix(data = c(1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
layout(draw)
layout.show(3)
par("mar") #Used this code due to the "Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large"
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
boxplot(Boston$nox)
boxplot(Boston$dis, horizontal = TRUE)
plot(Boston$dis, Boston$nox) ***

```

Look into the highest-crime neighborhood by making a single graph of one column of three rows:

* Find the row number, r, of the neighborhood with the highest "crim".
* Make a density plot of "crim". Include a rug to show the data.
* Add a red circle at (x, y) = (max crime rate, 0) to make this maximum crime rate stand out.
* Make a density plot with rug of "medv", adding a red circle at (x, y) = (medv[r], 0) to see what medv corresponds to the highest crime rate.
* Repeat the last step for "ptratio".

```{r}
***
which.max(Boston$crim) => 381
plot(density(Boston$crim))
rug(Boston$crim, col=2, lwd=2)
points(88.9726,0,pch=1, col=2)
plot(density(Boston$medv))
rug(Boston$medv, col=2, lwd=2)
points(Boston$medv[381],0,pch=1,col=2)
plot(density(Boston$ptratio))
rug(Boston$ptratio, col=2, lwd=2)
points(Boston$ptratio[381],0,pch=1,col=2) ***

```

What do you notice about the ptratio and medv for the highest-crime neighborhood?

***
I could see some correlations between each other. At the highest-crime neighborhood, medv, median value of owner-occupied homes in\$1000s, showed a low value about 10, and ptratio, the pupil-teacher ration by town, had a large value about 20.
